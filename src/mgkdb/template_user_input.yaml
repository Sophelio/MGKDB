# Confidence Metadata Guidelines:
#   Confidence | Description
#   -----------|----------------------------------------------------------------
#   3          | Simulation explicitly checked for convergence on at least one variable, add comments with details on which variable
#   2          | Simulation derived or restarted from more rigorously checked simulation in database
#   1          | Simulation checked visually for sufficiency, e.g.:
#              |   • Fluxes appear to saturate near end of simulation
#              |   • Perturbed structures not piling up at edge of simulated domains
#              |   • Flux contributions not dominating from wavenumbers at edge of simulated range
#   0          | Simulation output was generated
